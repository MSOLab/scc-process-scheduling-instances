[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5126007.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5126007)

This repository of problem instances for scheduling of steelmaking-continuous casting (SCC) process accompanies the paper An Iterated Greedy Matheuristic for Scheduling in Steelmaking-Continuous Casting Process by Hong et al. (2021, under revision)

A problem instance consists of four UTF-8-encoded files:

- Machine environment (*_mc_env.json)
- Processing time of charges in each required stage (*_pt.csv)
- Sequence of charges in each cast (*_cast.json)
- Due date of each charge (*_duedate.json)
